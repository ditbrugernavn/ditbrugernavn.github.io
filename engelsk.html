                <p>Anxiety is a big problem today in the society. Mental health is a big topic, and many disorders can show early in teens. Teens can get severe anxiety from social media and the fantasy that everyone is living their best life, but they aren’t themselves. School is a place where many teens experience unrealistic pressure and that often give them anxiety. The solution to anxiety among teens is treatment, but the society does not have enough money or resources to treat everyone. Parents is also a big reason to why so many teens live with anxiety. They tent to have high expectation for their kids and the teens therefore feel like they are disappointing their parents when they don’t do schoolwork good enough.
